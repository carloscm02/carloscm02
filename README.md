# Hi! I'm Carlos CÃ¡maras ðŸ‘‹
I'm a passionate software developer based in MÃ¡laga, specialized in building efficient and functional web solutions using technologies like NestJS, Angular, and other tools from the modern ecosystem. I believe in technology as a way to transform ideas into tangible realities.

I love dedicating my free time to side projects, where I can experiment with new technologies and face challenges that require creative solutions. I'm a strong advocate of open source and constant learning: whether it's exploring emerging trends, developing my own tools, or sharing knowledge with the tech community.

I also enjoy collaborating with motivated teams and projects that seek to make a positive impact. If you have an idea, a technical challenge, or just want to chat about technology, I'm just a message away!
